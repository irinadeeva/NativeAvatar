This project demonstrates the implementation of a **UINavigationController** with a large title and an interactive avatar image that moves and scales dynamically with the title during scrolling.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to create a screen where a large title and an avatar image behave cohesively during scrolling:

- **Avatar Icon**: Displays a `SF Symbols` icon (`person.crop.circle.fill`) with a size of 36x36pt.
- **Dynamic Movement**: The avatar moves and resizes along with the large title as the user scrolls.
- **Integration with Title**: The avatar maintains its position relative to the title, ensuring a smooth transition as the title collapses into the navigation bar.
